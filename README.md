###Overview
 
Our presentation is geared towards a real estate firm interested in refurbishing and flipping residential properties in the Seattle metropolitan area. Using the King County Housing dataset, we performed exploratory data analysis and built linear regression models to gain insights about the relationships between a number of independent variables and our target variable, price. We then utilized visualization techniques to present our findings and convey the rationale behind our recommendations to the stakeholder. Finally, we discussed limitations and steps we could take in a follow up study that would provide additional value to our stakeholder.  


###Business and Data Understanding

Given the stakeholders objective, we focused our analysis around two key considerations. The first was to understand the local market and neighborhood characteristics. Our goal was to identify locations for potential investment opportunities that we could recommend to our stakeholder based upon their budget. We determined which zip codes had the highest and lowest average sales prices, and how proximity to Medina, a wealthy city, affects the average house price. Our second consideration was to determine which types of renovation activities would yield the highest increase in sales price. Our linear regression model led us to focus on the overall condition of the property, as well as thoughtful construction that would increase square footage. 


###Conclusion

In conclusion, we have two recommendations for our stakeholders. The first is to purchase properties that have a “fair” building condition, and perform the renovations necessary to bring them up to an “average” condition or higher. Our reason for this recommendation is that “fair” condition properties do not require costly structural construction, but could be upgraded to a better condition through maintenance work and refinishing. Our analysis shows a clear price increase in the property as the condition level improves. Our second recommendation is to increase square footage in a thoughtful manner. Specifically, we recommend prioritizing the addition of bathrooms and bedrooms as those features had the biggest positive impact on price. A limitation of this study was the number of renovation features available to analyze. Additionally, we did not have our stakeholders budget and therefore could not recommend specific locations for investment. In a follow up study, we would like to work with the stakeholders budget and also analyze more property features to determine what additional types of renovations could increase resale value.
